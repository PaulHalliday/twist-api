# &#8627; Slash command

Slash command integrations are installed on a team level, and they add
a slash command to the system. When a user types `/command arguments`
your integration runs and can act upon the arguments.

**Examples**: `/gif funny cats` is a slash command. Another example is
the [appear.in](https://appear.in) integration, which lets you easily
schedule video meetings (`/appearin meeting-room`). Both integrations
are available on
our [integrations page](https://twistapp.com/integrations).


### Example implementation

```text
# formstring data

user_name: user_name
verify_token: 200_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx
thread_id: 180000
workspace_id: 4800
command_argument: appearin_username
command: /appear
thread_title: Test thread name
content: /appear appearin_username
event_type: comment
comment_id: 6402000
channel_name: General
channel_id: 6000
user_id: 9000
```

```json
# JSON return
{
    "content": "ðŸ“¹ [/appear appearin_username](https://appear.in/appearin_username)"
}
```

You can check some examples in the
[integration examples repository](https://github.com/Doist/twist-integration-examples/tree/master/slash_integration). Let's
use the
[python example implementation](https://github.com/Doist/twist-integration-examples/tree/master/slash_integration/python) for
the appear.in an example.

Your application will receive a POST call with some information in
formstring format, so the integration can decide what to do and it
reply with a JSON containing a `content` key. The text on this
`content` key will replace the message containing the slash command.
