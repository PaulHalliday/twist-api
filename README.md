Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.2.5 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle`
   command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Contributing

1. Fork this repository on Github.
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard
   drive with `git clone
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/twist-api.git`
3. `cd slate`
4. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with
   Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up

# OR run with docker
docker-compose up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567.
Make your changes and submit a [pull request back to Doist](https://github.com/Doist/twist-api/pulls).
